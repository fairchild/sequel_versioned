== Schema

The fact table needs for a versioned object both object_id and object_version attributes, the versioned object must have a fact_id.
For a versioned collection the fact table needs collection_version, and the collection objects must have a fact_id. 


== Model

The fact table needs to have a many_to_one association with each versioned object or collection.

To load the plugin in your Fact model
	
	is(:versioned_fact, {:collections => [Collection], :dimensions => [Dimension]})  
  

Then in your versioned models is :versioned_object or is :versioned_collection depending on what you need.

The method `version!` is available on the fact model, along with current_dimension and current_collection.
